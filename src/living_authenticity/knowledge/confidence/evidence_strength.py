"""Deterministic evidence-strength confidence assessor.

The guard reads only evidence already recorded by the earlier
analytical stages (the Proposal plus its underlying outcomes) and
describes that evidence as an ordinal strength level. Missing or
contradictory evidence lowers the level; it is never converted into
confidence. No numeric score is produced: the repository does not yet
define a justified numeric confidence scale, so uncertainty is
preserved as an explicit ordinal level instead of manufactured
precision.
