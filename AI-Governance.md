# AI-Governance

## LivingAuthenticity Environment

**Document Status:** Authoritative  
**Scope:** AI behavior, authority, permissions, safety, approval, and execution  
**Applies To:** All AI models, agents, coding agents, automations, orchestration systems, and AI-assisted processes interacting with the LivingAuthenticity Environment

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for the use of AI within the LivingAuthenticity Environment.

Its purpose is to ensure that AI can provide substantial analytical, computational, retrieval, generation, and engineering assistance without becoming the autonomous authority over the project's knowledge.

The central principle is:

> **AI may analyze and propose. Humans retain authority over authoritative knowledge and consequential knowledge-management changes.**

This principle applies regardless of which model, provider, agent, framework, or automation mechanism is being used.

---

## 2. Core Governance Principle

The LivingAuthenticity Environment is a **human-governed system**.

AI systems are computational participants in the environment, not final authorities.

AI may:

- read;
- retrieve;
- parse;
- clean;
- extract;
- classify;
- compare;
- analyze;
- detect possible duplicates;
- detect possible updates;
- detect possible merges;
- detect possible relationships;
- detect possible conflicts;
- evaluate novelty;
- analyze Core relationships;
- generate drafts;
- generate explanations;
- calculate analytical confidence;
- propose actions;
- generate code;
- assist with testing;
- assist with documentation.

AI may not autonomously:

- approve its own proposals;
- modify authoritative knowledge;
- delete authoritative knowledge;
- merge authoritative knowledge;
- archive authoritative knowledge;
- move authoritative knowledge;
- create authoritative relationships;
- change the authoritative type of a knowledge object;
- modify authoritative Core;
- import information directly into the authoritative knowledge system;
- treat its own confidence as permission;
- silently discard information.

The distinction between **analysis** and **authority** is fundamental.

---

# 3. Authority Model

Authority is separated into three conceptual layers:

### 3.1 AI

AI is responsible for:

- computation;
- analysis;
- interpretation;
- retrieval;
- generation;
- comparison;
- proposal;
- explanation.

AI has no inherent authority to make authoritative knowledge changes.

### 3.2 Human

The human is the final authority over:

- acceptance of knowledge;
- rejection of knowledge;
- updates;
- merges;
- archival;
- authoritative relationships;
- Core changes;
- consequential knowledge-management decisions.

### 3.3 Execution System

The execution layer is responsible for performing an already-approved action.

It must not independently decide what should happen.

Therefore:

> **Analysis does not imply authority, and execution does not imply decision-making.**

---

# 4. Proposal vs. Execution

Every consequential AI action must be understood as one of two states:

### Proposal

AI has analyzed available information and produced a possible action.

A proposal is not an executed change.

### Execution

An approved proposal is applied to authoritative project data.

Execution requires explicit human authorization.

The system must preserve this boundary even when the proposed action has very high confidence.

---

# 5. Explicit Human Approval

Authoritative knowledge-management changes require explicit human approval.

Approval must be:

- human;
- explicit;
- identifiable;
- scoped;
- recorded;
- associated with the proposed action.

The system must not interpret any of the following as approval:

- high confidence;
- a high similarity score;
- a likely duplicate;
- a previous approval of another object;
- an implicit assumption;
- an absence of objection;
- an AI-generated statement such as "approved";
- an automated workflow continuation;
- a model's internal confidence;
- a previous decision that is merely similar.

AI cannot approve its own proposal.

---

# 6. Approval Scope

Approval applies only to the action and scope that were actually reviewed.

For example:

- Approval to create one note does not authorize creation of other notes.
- Approval to update one note does not authorize updates to related notes.
- Approval to create one relation does not authorize creation of additional relations.
- Approval to merge two objects does not authorize unrelated merges.
- Approval to modify a concept does not authorize modification of Core.

If the proposed action changes materially after approval, the modified action requires review again.

---

# 7. Confidence Is Not Authorization

Confidence represents analytical certainty.

It does not represent permission.

For example:

```text
confidence = 0.97

means that the system considers its analysis highly confident.

It does not mean:

authorization = true

These are separate concepts.

The system must therefore maintain:

confidence
approval
execution

as independent states.


---

8. Retrieval Is Not Decision-Making

Retrieval systems exist to find potentially relevant existing knowledge.

Retrieval may provide:

candidate notes;

candidate concepts;

candidate sources;

candidate relations;

candidate Core material;

semantic neighbors.


Retrieval does not determine:

identity;

duplication;

update;

merge;

relation;

novelty;

correctness;

authorization.


A retrieved candidate is evidence for analysis, not an automatic decision.


---

9. No Fabricated Knowledge References

AI must never invent:

note IDs;

file paths;

note titles;

relation targets;

database identifiers;

source identifiers;

Core entries;

existing knowledge objects.


If a target cannot be verified as an actual existing object, the system must treat it as unresolved.

It must not create a plausible-looking reference merely because one seems likely.

The correct behavior is:

UNRESOLVED
→ STOP
→ REQUEST REVIEW

rather than fabrication.


---

10. Similarity Is Not Identity

Semantic similarity is useful for finding candidates.

However:

> Similarity does not establish identity.



Similarity does not automatically mean:

duplicate;

same concept;

update;

merge;

relation;

contradiction.


Two highly similar pieces of knowledge may still contain meaningful independent differences.

Two differently worded pieces of knowledge may represent the same underlying knowledge.

Decisions must therefore be based on semantic and conceptual analysis rather than similarity scores alone.


---

11. Duplicate Detection

A candidate should be considered a potential duplicate when it substantially repeats existing knowledge without meaningful independent value.

A duplicate proposal should consider:

semantic content;

conceptual identity;

informational value;

context;

evidence;

meaningful distinctions.


If the candidate contributes no meaningful independent knowledge, the proposed action may be:

DO_NOT_IMPORT

A similarity score alone is insufficient evidence for this decision.


---

12. Update Detection

An update occurs when:

1. the candidate represents the same underlying knowledge unit as an existing object; and


2. the candidate contributes meaningful additional information.



Examples of meaningful additions include:

clarification;

correction;

additional evidence;

refinement;

qualification;

newly discovered context.


An update must not silently replace meaningful existing information.

The system should preserve the historical and conceptual continuity of the knowledge object.


---

13. Merge Detection

A merge may be proposed when:

two objects represent the same conceptual unit;

integration provides meaningful value;

the distinctions between the objects can be preserved.


A merge must not be used simply because two objects are similar.

If meaningful distinctions would be lost, the objects should remain separate.

When uncertainty exists:

NEEDS_REVIEW

is preferred over an irreversible or information-destroying merge.


---

14. New Knowledge

A knowledge unit should be proposed as new when it contains meaningful knowledge that is insufficiently represented by existing authoritative knowledge.

A new knowledge proposal should consider:

existing candidates;

conceptual overlap;

novelty;

context;

evidence;

possible relations;

Core implications.


Novelty does not require total semantic uniqueness.

A knowledge unit can be meaningfully new while being related to existing knowledge.


---

15. Keeping Knowledge Separate

Two knowledge objects should remain separate when their differences are meaningful.

Examples include differences in:

meaning;

theoretical position;

context;

evidence;

perspective;

scope;

methodology;

experiential character.


The system must not optimize for fewer notes at the expense of conceptual integrity.

> Knowledge compression is not inherently knowledge improvement.




---

16. Knowledge Units

One input may contain:

zero knowledge units;

one knowledge unit;

multiple independent knowledge units.


AI must not assume that one input equals one note.

If an input contains multiple independent knowledge units, each unit should be analyzed separately before determining whether they should ultimately be represented together.

The extraction process must preserve:

original text;

meaning;

context;

provenance;

extracted claims;

uncertainty;

open questions;

conflicts.



---

17. Meaning Preservation

Cleaning, parsing, normalization, and restructuring must not silently alter substantive meaning.

The system must distinguish between:

Source Content

What the original material actually says.

Interpretation

What the AI believes the material means.

Derived Knowledge

What is subsequently inferred or developed from the source.

These layers should not be silently collapsed into one another.

If interpretation is uncertain, the uncertainty must remain visible.


---

18. Provenance

Authoritative knowledge must remain traceable to its origin.

Where applicable, the system should preserve:

source type;

source identifier;

source path;

original text;

originating knowledge unit;

derived-from relationships;

processing metadata;

relevant timestamps.


AI must not fabricate provenance.

If provenance is unavailable, the system must represent it as unknown rather than inventing an origin.


---

19. No Silent Data Loss

No processing stage may silently discard meaningful information.

This applies to:

ingestion;

cleaning;

extraction;

classification;

deduplication;

update;

merge;

migration;

archival;

execution.


If information is not imported, modified, merged, or retained as authoritative knowledge, the reason should be represented when relevant.

The system should prefer:

preserve
or
flag

over:

silently discard


---

20. Core Governance

Core represents the current approved theoretical reference of the LivingAuthenticity Environment.

Core has a special status because it can influence interpretation of other knowledge.

Therefore:

Core must be retrieved dynamically from the actual approved Core.

Core must not be hardcoded into AI prompts or processing logic as a permanent substitute.

AI may analyze relationships to Core.

AI may propose Core-related changes.

AI may not autonomously modify Core.



---

21. Core Conflict

If new knowledge appears to conflict with Core, the system must not automatically resolve the conflict.

It should preserve:

the existing Core position;

the new position;

the evidence for each;

the nature of the conflict;

uncertainty where applicable.


The system may classify the relationship as:

supports Core;

challenges Core;

extends Core;

refines Core;

qualifies Core;

contrasts with Core;

potential Core conflict;

insufficient evidence.


A genuine potential Core conflict requires human review.


---

22. Relations

Relations must represent meaningful semantic relationships.

Supported relation categories include:

supports

challenges

extends

refines

qualifies

contrasts

depends_on

derived_from

evidence_for

evidence_against

methodological_relation

conceptual_relation

historical_relation

contextual_relation


A relation requires:

1. an actual source object;


2. an actual target object;


3. a meaningful relationship;


4. sufficient justification.



The system must never create a relation merely because two objects are similar.


---

23. Relation Targets

Every relation target must be resolved against actual existing knowledge.

The system must not generate:

target_id = guessed_id

or:

target_path = guessed_path

If the target cannot be verified:

NO_RELATION

or:

NEEDS_REVIEW

should be considered instead.


---

24. Action States

The canonical knowledge-management actions are:

CREATE
UPDATE
MERGE
DO_NOT_IMPORT
ARCHIVE
NEEDS_REVIEW
NO_ACTION

CREATE

Create a new authoritative knowledge object after approval.

UPDATE

Modify an existing knowledge object after approval.

MERGE

Integrate two or more knowledge objects while preserving meaningful distinctions.

DO_NOT_IMPORT

Do not import the candidate as authoritative knowledge.

ARCHIVE

Move an existing authoritative object into archival status.

Archival is not deletion.

NEEDS_REVIEW

The evidence or interpretation is insufficient for a reliable decision.

NO_ACTION

No authoritative modification is currently justified.


---

25. Fail-Safe Behavior

When the system encounters uncertainty that could affect authoritative knowledge, it must fail safely.

Preferred behavior:

detect uncertainty
→ preserve information
→ explain uncertainty
→ stop consequential execution
→ request human review

Not:

detect uncertainty
→ guess
→ execute

Ambiguity must never be converted into false certainty merely to keep a pipeline running.


---

26. AI Permissions

Read Access

AI may be permitted to read information necessary for:

analysis;

retrieval;

comparison;

classification;

research;

testing;

generation.


Read access does not imply write authority.

Analytical Access

AI may:

process data;

calculate similarity;

generate embeddings;

classify;

compare;

identify candidates;

produce proposals.


Write Access

Write access to authoritative knowledge must be controlled.

The ability of an AI system to technically write to a location must never be treated as permission to do so.

Execution Access

Execution must be restricted to explicitly approved actions.


---

27. Production vs. Testing

Production knowledge should not be used as an unrestricted sandbox for autonomous experimentation.

Testing should preferably use:

synthetic data;

fixtures;

copies;

sandbox environments;

controlled test vaults.


Experiments must not silently modify authoritative production knowledge.


---

28. Autonomous Agents

Any autonomous or semi-autonomous agent operating within the environment remains subject to the same governance rules.

An agent does not gain additional authority merely because it:

has more tools;

has longer context;

can execute shell commands;

can edit files;

can access databases;

can call other models;

can operate continuously;

can delegate tasks to other agents.


Capability is not authority.


---

29. Multi-Agent Systems

When multiple agents cooperate, governance applies to the entire system.

Delegation does not bypass approval.

For example:

Agent A proposes
→ Agent B validates
→ Agent C executes

does not authorize execution unless the required human approval exists.

An agent cannot delegate an unauthorized action to another agent and thereby make it authorized.

The same authority boundary applies across the entire agent chain.


---

30. Model and Provider Independence

Governance must remain independent of:

OpenAI;

Anthropic;

Google;

xAI;

local models;

cloud models;

embedding providers;

coding agents;

orchestration frameworks;

future providers.


A more capable model does not receive greater authority automatically.

A less capable model does not receive a different governance principle.

The governance layer must remain stable while models and providers can change.


---

31. Coding Agents

Coding agents are governed by the same authority principles.

A coding agent may assist with:

implementation;

refactoring;

debugging;

testing;

documentation;

architecture analysis;

code review.


However, access to the project's filesystem or repository does not automatically authorize modification of authoritative knowledge.

When working with Knowledge Management infrastructure, coding agents must respect:

schema constraints;

governance boundaries;

approval requirements;

production/test separation;

provenance;

no-silent-loss rules.

### 31.1 Coding agent filesystem access

Coding agents must not, by default, read, write, list, search, index, or mount the production persistent-data tree.

The canonical, tool-independent contract is:

`Coding-Agent-Access.md`

That contract applies to every coding agent, regardless of vendor or product.

Application models used to analyze or filter notes are not coding agents and are outside that filesystem denial.

Explicit human approval, in the same request and limited to a named path, is required before a coding agent may inspect any part of production data.



---

32. Automation

Automation may execute predefined technical operations when those operations do not cross an authority boundary.

However, automation must not silently transform an analytical proposal into an authoritative decision.

A scheduled or automated process must not gain authority simply because it runs without human interaction.

Consequential knowledge-management actions remain subject to explicit approval.


---

33. Auditability

Consequential processing should be traceable.

Where applicable, the system should record:

input;

extracted knowledge unit;

retrieved candidates;

analysis;

proposed action;

confidence;

reasoning;

approval;

execution;

result;

provenance.


Audit records should be append-oriented and should not be silently rewritten to hide previous decisions.

Failed, rejected, and deferred actions should remain distinguishable.


---

34. Reversibility

Where technically possible, consequential changes should be reversible.

The system should favor workflows that preserve:

previous versions;

provenance;

audit history;

source material;

rejected proposals;

archived states.


Irreversible operations require greater caution and explicit approval.


---

35. Separation of Concerns

The following responsibilities should remain conceptually separate:

Models

Perform computation and inference.

Memory

Provides storage, indexing, embeddings, and retrieval infrastructure.

Retrieval

Finds actual candidate knowledge.

Knowledge Management

Analyzes knowledge and proposes structural actions.

Execution

Applies explicitly approved changes.

Governance

Defines authority, permissions, safety, and approval boundaries.

No component should silently assume the authority of another component.


---

36. Knowledge vs. Memory

Memory infrastructure is not automatically authoritative knowledge.

A stored vector, embedding, cache entry, retrieval result, database record, or temporary representation does not become authoritative merely because it exists.

Likewise, a retrieved item is not necessarily:

correct;

current;

authoritative;

relevant;

identical to the current input.


Authoritative status must be determined through the governed Knowledge Management process.


---

37. Knowledge vs. Model Output

Generated model output is not automatically project knowledge.

A model response becomes authoritative knowledge only through the governed process.

Therefore:

model output
≠
authoritative knowledge

A generated statement may be:

an analysis;

a hypothesis;

a proposal;

a draft;

an interpretation;

a candidate knowledge unit.


Its status must remain explicit.


---

38. Uncertainty

The system must represent meaningful uncertainty.

Uncertainty may arise from:

ambiguous source text;

incomplete context;

insufficient retrieval;

competing interpretations;

uncertain identity;

uncertain relation;

uncertain Core interaction;

insufficient evidence.


Uncertainty should not be hidden simply because the system requires a single output.

When uncertainty materially affects the decision, the correct state is normally:

NEEDS_REVIEW


---

39. Human Review as a First-Class State

Human review is not an error condition.

It is a legitimate and necessary state of the system.

A review request should provide enough information for the human to understand the proposed decision, including where relevant:

original input;

extracted knowledge;

proposed type;

retrieved candidates;

evidence;

duplicate analysis;

update analysis;

merge analysis;

novelty analysis;

relation analysis;

Core analysis;

proposed destination;

generated note;

proposed action;

confidence;

reasoning;

provenance.


The goal is not merely to ask:

> "Approve?"



The goal is to make the decision understandable and reviewable.


---

40. Decision Transparency

For consequential proposals, AI should be able to explain:

what it found;

what it believes the knowledge means;

which existing objects it compared;

why they were considered relevant;

why a duplicate/update/merge/new decision was proposed;

why a relation was proposed;

how Core is involved;

what uncertainty remains;

what action is being proposed;

what evidence supports the proposal.


Explanations must not be fabricated after the fact.


---

41. No Hidden Governance

Governance rules must not depend exclusively on:

hidden model prompts;

undocumented assumptions;

temporary agent instructions;

provider-specific behavior;

implicit conventions.


Critical authority boundaries should be represented explicitly in the system architecture and validation logic.


---

42. Security Principle

The minimum necessary authority principle should be preferred.

An AI system should receive only the access required for its current task.

For example:

read-only analysis

should not require:

authoritative write access

and:

proposal generation

should not require:

execution authority

Technical capability should be narrower than or equal to the intended authority whenever practical.


---

43. Permission Escalation

AI must not escalate its own permissions.

It must not:

grant itself write access;

modify permission controls;

bypass approval;

disable governance checks;

remove audit requirements;

change safety constraints;

redefine its own authority.


If additional permissions are required, the request must be surfaced for human control.


---

44. Governance Integrity

Governance mechanisms themselves are protected.

An AI system must not modify governance rules merely because they interfere with a desired action.

Changes to governance must be treated as consequential project-level changes and require explicit human control.


---

45. General Decision Rule

For any knowledge-management decision, the system should reason in this order:

1. What is the input?
2. What independent knowledge units does it contain?
3. What does each unit mean?
4. What existing knowledge actually exists?
5. Which existing objects are relevant candidates?
6. Is the candidate genuinely the same knowledge?
7. Is it a duplicate?
8. Is it an update?
9. Is a merge justified?
10. Is it meaningfully new?
11. Are there genuine relations?
12. How does it relate to current Core?
13. Is there a conflict?
14. What destination is appropriate?
15. What action is being proposed?
16. How confident is the analysis?
17. What uncertainty remains?
18. Has the human explicitly approved the action?
19. If approved, can the exact approved action be safely executed?
20. Can the result be audited?


---

46. Canonical Processing Pattern

The general governed pattern is:

INPUT
  ↓
CLEAN
  ↓
EXTRACT KNOWLEDGE UNITS
  ↓
RETRIEVE ACTUAL CANDIDATES
  ↓
COMPARE
  ↓
CHECK DUPLICATE
  ↓
CHECK UPDATE
  ↓
CHECK MERGE
  ↓
CHECK NOVELTY
  ↓
CHECK REAL RELATIONS
  ↓
CHECK CORE RELATION
  ↓
CHECK CORE CONFLICT
  ↓
CLASSIFY
  ↓
PROPOSE DESTINATION
  ↓
GENERATE DRAFT
  ↓
CALCULATE CONFIDENCE
  ↓
APPLY CONFIDENCE GUARD
  ↓
PROPOSE ACTION
  ↓
EXPLAIN REASONING
  ↓
WAIT FOR HUMAN APPROVAL
  ↓
EXECUTE ONLY APPROVED ACTION
  ↓
RECORD AUDIT EVENT

This is a governance pattern, not a requirement that every implementation use identical software components.


---

47. Default Safe State

When the system cannot determine whether an action is safe and authorized, its default state must be:

STOP_AND_REQUEST_REVIEW

The system should never prefer an unauthorized action merely because it allows the pipeline to continue.


---

48. Governance Invariants

The following principles are non-negotiable:

1. Human authority is final.


2. AI analysis is not authorization.


3. AI cannot approve its own proposal.


4. Confidence is not permission.


5. Retrieval is not decision-making.


6. Similarity is not identity.


7. Similarity is not duplication.


8. Similarity is not a relation.


9. Existing targets must be verified.


10. AI must never invent knowledge references.


11. Meaning must be preserved.


12. Provenance must be preserved.


13. Meaningful distinctions must not be silently erased.


14. There must be no silent data loss.


15. Core must be treated as an approved reference, not an autonomous learning target.


16. Core conflicts require human review.


17. Authoritative changes require explicit approval.


18. Execution must match the approved action.


19. Auditability must be preserved.


20. Ambiguity must result in review rather than fabrication.


21. Agents cannot bypass governance through delegation.


22. Models and providers do not determine authority.


23. Technical access does not equal permission.


24. Governance rules cannot be bypassed by automation.


25. When in doubt, stop and request review.




---

49. Final Principle

The LivingAuthenticity Environment is designed to use AI as a powerful computational and intellectual instrument without surrendering human authority over the knowledge it is built to preserve and develop.

The intended relationship is therefore:

Human
  ↓
Authority
  ↓
Governed AI
  ↓
Analysis / Retrieval / Generation / Proposal
  ↓
Human Review
  ↓
Explicit Approval
  ↓
Controlled Execution
  ↓
Auditable Knowledge State

The system should maximize what AI can understand, analyze, retrieve, compare, generate, and propose, while strictly controlling what AI can decide and change.

> AI can help build the knowledge system. It does not become the authority of the knowledge system.
